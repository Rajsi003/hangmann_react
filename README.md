Designed and developed a highly interactive and smooth Hangman game using React, featuring real-time hangman figure drawing, live tracking of incorrect and correct letter inputs, and an engaging end-of-game pop-up that clearly indicates win/loss status. The game offers a seamless user experience with an intuitive interface and a 'Play Again' option, ensuring players can easily restart and enjoy the game multiple times. This project demonstrates expertise in React, frontend development, and creating dynamic, user-focused web applications.
